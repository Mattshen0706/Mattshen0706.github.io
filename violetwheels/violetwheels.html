    <div class="paragraph"><p>New York City thrives on its massive transportation network, moving millions across its boroughs daily. As part of PlaNYC’s push to improve quality of life and cut carbon emissions, the city has prioritized investments in public transit, walking, and biking. But despite these efforts, biking remains the least utilized option, with only 2.6% of commuters choosing it (PlaNYC). With 472 subway stations and over 3 million daily riders (MTA), the subway is the backbone of NYC’s commute. While it’s a step in the right direction for energy efficiency, there’s still huge potential for an even greener system, one that better integrates bikes and makes use of existing bike infrastructure.
        However, launching a citywide campaign to promote biking comes with challenges. Mayor Adams once explored subsidizing CitiBike in 2021, but budget constraints kept it from moving forward (Brachfeld). Rather than tackling NYC as a whole, a more practical starting point would be focusing on a specific community such as NYU. 
        By working with NYU and CitiBike, we can work to introduce a discounted or complimentary CitiBike membership for students, making biking a more convenient and affordable option. Using NYU as a pilot program, we can collect data on how improved access impacts student ridership. If successful, this could serve as a model for expanding bike access across the city, making sustainable transportation a more realistic choice for more New Yorkers.

        Since the 1800s, when biking was first introduced in New York City, biking culture has undergone intense changes. At first, there were concerns that biking put everyone's lives at risk, so in 1880, officials tried to outlaw bikes from the city’s parks for the safety of everyone. Bikes were still used, however, to run daily errands and to feel a sense of freedom, specifically for women, minorities, and immigrants (Mcshane). Bikes stood as a symbol for these groups, since they provided a sense of belonging in a huge city. 
	This fear of biking lasted throughout the years, however, causing countless disagreements between politicians and residents, like in 1980 when cyclists had a sit-in on the Avenue of Americas to protest the removal of the bike lanes (Mcshane). As a result, actions were taken to find a middle ground that would let bikes coexist peacefully. In 1938, one of the first bike paths was introduced in Queens on the Northern State Parkway (Sixthreezero). In 2007, NYC added its first protected bike lane on 9th avenue (Mcshane). These two events on their own started the domino effect of building bike paths throughout the city. The history of biking is important in demonstrating how since change has been successful in the past, future change is possible, which is what we are asking you to help with today.

        Change is possible; as of now, 1,240+ miles of bike lanes have been installed and more than 480 miles of these lanes are protected. Also, bike paths in parks have also been on the rise. This increase in bike lanes, as well as the introduction of bike sharing, has dramatically increased users. From 2012-2017, there was a 26% growth of bike riders, which is about 175,000 people, and the average annual growth of daily cycling was 9.1% (Cycling in the City). 
This increase is thanks to developments in the city’s infrastructure, accessibility, safety, and awareness. Nearly 1.9 million New Yorkers ride bikes, so streets need to be adapted to safely fit cars, bikes, and pedestrians (Bikes and Pedestrians). In September 2021, a new bike lane was introduced on the Brooklyn Bridge to allow for biking that did not intervene with other modes of transportation. This caused biking over the bridge to double (Bikes and Pedestrians). 
If these changes have been successful in the city, what is stopping NYU from integrating it into their university? We are hoping that we can bring these changes to NYU students by increasing the number of student bike users. We think that collaborating with a pre-existing company, like CitiBike, would be beneficial for finding a solution. Citi Bike was launched in 2013 and quickly became the biggest bike sharing system in North America, with 17.6 million Citi Bike trips in 2018 (Cycling in the City). We plan to grow this number by increasing the number of NYU CitiBike users, but this cannot be done without help from the company,

    Biking culture in New York City has experienced significant growth over the past few decades. Efforts to expand bike lanes for enhanced safety, along with the creation of the Citi Bike share program, have played a crucial role in promoting biking as a viable mode of transportation. Despite these advancements, biking remains underutilized in the broader context, with only 26% of adults having ridden a bike in the past year (NYC DOT, 2021) and 2.6% of New Yorkers considering it their primary mode of transport (PlanNYC, 2023). Our research suggests that the primary barrier to wider adoption of biking is the fear of safety while riding. 
    The above diagram illustrates the frequency amongst the 26% of New Yorkers who have riden a bike in 2021. Almost 40% of the supposed bike riders say that they have used a bike only a few times within the year, further emphasizing the underutilisation of bikes in the city.

        <div class="paragraph">
            There still are drawbacks of biking, but we can use them as a way to brainstorm how our solution can be successful. As previously mentioned, there were a lot of fears expressed about the safety of biking. When 3 pedestrians were killed by cyclists in the late 1900s, these fears grew dramatically (Sixthreezero). In 2024, over 19 bikers were killed and 339 were seriously injured thanks to lack of biking safety infrastructure (Record-Breaking). At this point, fears were at a high. 
            NYC roads are not meant to be shared. The city’s streets were originally designed to only fit traffic of cars, there are too many unprotected bike lanes, and there is no respect between bikers, drivers, and police (Infante). We realize that in order to have a successful solution for NYU students, we must figure out a way to mitigate these fears. NYC is constantly trying to increase safety for bikers by increasing protected bike lanes and making cycling the norm. By implementing NYC’s biking changes around Washington Square and MetroTech, more NYU students can increase their biking usage.             
           <br><br>
           Not only has NYC undergone tremendous biking practice changes, but they are continuing their efforts in the future. The city is continuing to work to develop the city’s greenways and add more space for biking, specifically 100 miles of non-street bike lanes. This space does not interfere with limited-space streets which helps mitigate previously mentioned fears (Bikes and Pedestrians). NYC is also building its infrastructure around the growing biking community by continuing to brainstorm ideas of how to let vehicles, bikes, and pedestrians coexist (Sixthreezero). Also, bike sharing services are expected to expand, including increasing coverage areas of already existing services (Why You Should). Hopefully this expansion, as well as the city’s other future efforts, will include a solution to bring NYU students into the biking network, whether it be through a bike sharing program or by generally increasing students’ desire to bike.

        Biking is one of the most effective and accessible ways to combat climate change, especially in densely populated cities like New York. Replacing even a single car trip with a bike ride can drastically cut down an individual’s carbon footprint by nearly 67% (How Riding). Cars emit nearly five metric tons of CO₂ per year (How Riding), and switching to bikes, which produce only about 21 grams of CO₂ per kilometer compared to 271 grams for cars, can significantly reduce the greenhouse gases contributing to global warming (Bike Portland). In fact, if more New Yorkers opted to bike for short errands or commutes, transportation-related emissions, one of the top contributors to climate change would greatly decrease (How Riding).
        The environmental benefits of biking extend beyond just CO₂ reductions. Biking instead of driving helps eliminate harmful chemicals, particulates, and nitrogen oxides from the air, which improves overall air quality and can reduce rates of respiratory illness and disease (How Riding). Programs like Citi Bike have already made a meaningful impact, cutting about 900 tons of CO₂ each month and saving over 30,000 tonnes of emissions over a four-year period (The Science Survey; Discovery UCL). On top of that, biking contributes to quieter, less congested neighborhoods. Unlike cars or even subways, which contribute to noise pollution, bikes offer a near-silent alternative, promoting a more peaceful and livable urban environment. By incorporating cycling into everyday routines, even if its just once a week, individuals can help eliminate millions of tons of carbon emissions annually (How Riding), paving the way for a cleaner, quieter, and healthier city.

        In order to make improvements to the current bike share systems at NYU and NYC, it is important to look into the integration of bike share in other countries around the world. Whilst different countries and cities are likely at different stages of bike adoption, it is useful to see the different approaches which countries are taking. Data sets from ten major cities were taken from their local bike providers as well as news articles to compare each cities progress towards incorporating bikes into the cities transportation network.

        From the data collected above, we can see that the top three cities outside of New York which has found the most success with bike share (in terms of monthly ridership and number of bikes in the city)  are Shanghai, Paris and Singapore in no particular order. In the following section, we will dive further into these three cities, looking at what they have done well and how they can improve.

        One promising initiative NYU could adopt to promote sustainable transportation is launching its own bike rental program exclusively for students, faculty, and staff. With a simple ID-based check-out system, members of the NYU community could borrow a bike from designated campus hubs and return it after use, ensuring accessibility and accountability. Each rental would come equipped with a secure lock and optional helmet to prioritize safety and convenience. This program would not only provide a reliable alternative to short car or subway trips, but also help reduce campus-related emissions and ease congestion around NYU buildings. Additionally, NYU could partner with Citi Bike to offer subsidized memberships, making city-wide bike access more affordable for students. By integrating both a campus-specific system and expanded public bike access, NYU can take a significant step toward a cleaner, healthier, and more climate-conscious campus culture.
