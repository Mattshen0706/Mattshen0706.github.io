        New York City thrives on its massive transportation network, moving millions of people across its five boroughs daily. In response to PlaNYC’s push to protect residents from climate change consequences and decrease the city's contributions to climate change, the city has prioritized investments in public transit, walking, and biking. Currently, NYC heavily relies on its subway system, which includes 472 subway stations and over 3 million daily riders (MTA). While NYC’s subway system is a step in the right direction towards PlanNYC’s goals, there is still huge potential for an even greener system that involves a different type of transit.  
        By better integrating bikes and making use of existing bike infrastructure in NYC, we can start to achieve a greener city. As of now, biking is the least utilized option for transit, with only 2.6% of commuters choosing it (PlaNYC). We hope that by increasing bike usage to obtain a greener city, the percentage of commuters will also increase. Though we would love to work with the city as a whole to try and increase everyone’s biking usage, launching a citywide campaign to promote biking comes with challenges. Mayor Adams once explored subsidizing CitiBike, a prominent bike sharing system in NYC, in 2021, but budget constraints kept it from moving forward (Brachfeld). Rather than tackling NYC as a whole, we will focus on a specific community such as NYU. We hope to increase the percentage of biking commuters, and bikers in general, by better incorporating a biking program into NYU that is specifically aimed at undergraduate students.
        Whether it is through Violet Wheels, our proposed NYU bike rental program, or a collaboration between the university and Citibike, which would introduce a discounted or complimentary CitiBike membership for students, we can work to make biking a more convenient and affordable option. We also aim to increase the attractiveness of biking, since many associated fears might hinder student biking. We plan to do this through new clubs and events that help dismantle the fears. If successful, this could serve as a model for expanding bike access across the city, making sustainable transportation a more realistic choice for more New Yorkers.

        Since the 1800s, when biking was first introduced in New York City, biking culture has undergone intense changes. At first, there were concerns that biking put everyone's lives at risk, so in 1880, officials tried to outlaw bikes from the city’s parks for the safety of everyone, but that did not stop people from using bikes (Mcshane). In 1938, one of the first bike paths was introduced in Queens on the Northern State Parkway (Sixthreezero). In 2007, NYC added its first protected bike lane on 9th avenue (Mcshane). Due to the continued bike usage in 1880 and the success of the 1938 and 2007 bike lanes, the city realized biking would not stop, so cars must coexist with bikes. Since then, the city has undergone several changes to accommodate the 2 modes of transportation. With this, biking usage skyrocketed.

        As of now, 1,240+ miles of bike lanes have been installed and more than 480 miles of these lanes are protected. This increase in bike lanes, as well as the introduction of bike sharing, has dramatically increased users. From 2012-2017, there was a 26% growth of bike riders, which is about 175,000 people, and the average annual growth of daily cycling was 9.1% (Cycling in the City). CitiBike launched in 2013 and quickly became one of the main reasons for the increased number of bike riders in NYC; In 2018, there were 17.6 million Citi Bike trips (Cycling in the City). The increase in biking in NYC is also thanks to developments in the city’s infrastructure, accessibility, safety, and awareness (Bikes and Pedestrians). In September 2021, a new bike lane was introduced on the Brooklyn Bridge to allow for biking that did not intervene with other modes of transportation. This caused biking over the bridge to double (Bikes and Pedestrians). We hope that NYU students will see this increase in protection and bike usage as a sign to hop on a bike themselves. The city is obviously concerned about society’s fears on biking and is working hard, specifically by increasing protected bike lanes, to bring biking practices into the city’s norm. We are hoping that we can bring biking into NYU’s norm by increasing the number of student bike users.

        Despite these advancements, biking remains underutilized in the broader context, with only 26% of adults having ridden a bike in the past year (NYC DOT, 2021) and 2.6% of New Yorkers considering it their primary mode of transport (PlanNYC, 2023). Our research suggests that the primary barrier to wider adoption of biking is the fear of safety while riding. The above diagram illustrates the frequency amongst the 26% of New Yorkers who have ridden a bike in 2021. Almost 40% of the supposed bike riders say that they have used a bike only a few times within the year, further emphasizing the underutilisation of bikes in the city.    </div>
    <div style="width:100%"><img style="width:50%;"src="MEDIA/bicycledanger.png"></div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            As previously mentioned, there were a lot of fears expressed about the safety of biking. When 3 pedestrians were killed by cyclists in the late 1900s, these fears grew dramatically (Sixthreezero). In 2024, over 19 bikers were killed and 339 were seriously injured thanks to lack of biking safety infrastructure (Record-Breaking). Having this fear is valid; The city’s streets were originally designed to only fit traffic of cars, there are too many unprotected bike lanes, and there is no respect between bikers, drivers, and police (Infante). We realize that in order to have a successful solution for NYU students, we must figure out a way to mitigate these fears. NYC is constantly trying to increase safety for bikers by increasing protected bike lanes and making cycling the norm. By implementing protected bike lanes, increasing biking infrastructure, and creating awareness for biking safety around Washington Square and MetroTech, more NYU students can increase their biking usage.

    <div class="paragraph">
        Biking plays a critical role in building a more sustainable, healthier New York City especially as transportation remains one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. By shifting even a portion of daily commutes from cars to bikes, individuals and institutions like NYU can make a measurable impact on the climate crisis and urban quality of life.
<br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: </span>
        Replacing a single car trip with a bike ride can lower an individual’s carbon footprint by nearly 67% (How Riding). On average, cars emit nearly five metric tons of CO₂ per year, while bikes generate only about 21 grams of CO₂ per kilometer, compared to 271 grams for cars (Bike Portland). Widespread adoption of cycling for short commutes and errands could significantly reduce transportation-related emissions across the city.
        
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Improving Air Quality and Public Health: </span>
        
        Beyond CO₂, biking also reduces the release of harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxides and particulates that degrade air quality and increase rates of respiratory illness (How Riding). Encouraging NYU students and staff to bike, especially for local travel between campus buildings or nearby neighborhoods, can help create cleaner air zones around the university and reduce exposure to toxic emissions.
        
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Existing Impact and Scalable Benefits: </span>
        
        Programs like Citi Bike have already demonstrated the power of biking in urban environments—cutting approximately 900 tons of CO₂ per month and saving over 30,000 tonnes of emissions in just four years (The Science Survey; Discovery UCL). Expanding access to similar programs through NYU partnerships or campus-centered initiatives like Violet Wheels would build on this success, allowing more members of the NYU community to contribute to emission reductions at scale.
        
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Reducing Noise and Traffic Congestion: </span>
        Unlike cars or even subways, bikes are nearly silent, helping to cut down on noise pollution and create calmer, more livable city blocks. As more people opt for biking, traffic congestion also eases—supporting a safer and more accessible campus environment for pedestrians and cyclists alike.
        
        By embedding biking into NYU’s transportation culture, whether through a dedicated bike rental system or subsidized access to citywide networks, NYU can support broader climate action goals while modeling what local, scalable sustainability can look like. Even small shifts in behavior, like biking once a week, can help eliminate millions of tons of carbon emissions annually, paving the way for a cleaner, quieter, and more climate-resilient city.

        In order to make improvements to the current bike share systems at NYU and NYC, it is important to look into the integration of bike share in other countries around the world. Whilst different countries and cities are likely at different stages of bike adoption, it is useful to see the different approaches which countries are taking. Data sets from ten major cities were taken from their local bike providers as well as news articles to compare each cities progress towards incorporating bikes into the cities transportation network.

        Majority of the statistics are from the bike share providers themselves however some data were sampled from city transportation reports as well as news articles. There was an effort to collect the most current data ranging from 2020 to 2024. Additionally whilst these statistics may show some trends such as correlation between membership price and the operating size of the bikeshare companies, it’s important to understand that conclusions purely from the statistics is not an accurate representation of the full situation as there are many other factors which play a role into understanding the different bike share markets such as government subsidies, average household income and even crime rates/road traffic incidents. However, what we can infer from the data is the development of bike share schemes within the city, which would later help aid the research on which countries we should learn from. From the data collected above, we can see that the top three cities outside of New York which have found the most success with bike share (in terms of monthly ridership and number of bikes in the city) are Shanghai, Paris and Singapore in no particular order. In the following section, we will dive further into these three cities, looking at what they have done well and how they can improve.

        A surge in China's bike market started from 77 venture capitals seeking to fill the gap in the market (QPSoftware). The population itself has also seen a big surge in its public bike usage over the past years. As of 2022, China’s bike share market is the largest in the world with its leading public bike providers being Meituan Bikes. By 2019, bike sharing will become the third largest mode of transport in the country. Unlike New York and Paris with their bike docking system, for most instances the public bikes in China do not have designated docs allowing for open parking. Whilst convenient for users this has led to a major issue of bikes being left everywhere and becoming a burden to surrounding infrastructures. Since many startups tried rushing into the market with their own bike share, the ones who were unsuccessful ended up abandoning their bikes on sidewalks all around china leading to a “graveyard” of bikes. To address this issue, earlier this year in 2025, China updated the policy for electric bike trade-ins. Individuals who bring in their old bikes and purchase eligible new models are eligible for heavy subsidies. This initiative is to address the problem of having an abundance of obsolete electric bikes which may pose safety risks to the public. In 2024, 1.38 million electric bikes were exchanged with subsidy funds exceeding 600 million yuan.

            Singapore’s current main bikeshare provider started as a local business funded on World-Car-Free Day in 2017 and has transformed into the bikeshare powerhouse, “Anywheel”. Such a densely developed bikeshare system in one of the smallest countries in the world is truly formidable. Now the question is what makes Singapore’s bikeshare system so successful. The Singapore Land Transport Authority (LTA), run by the Singapore Government, collaborates closely with Anywheel, ensuring proper management of the bikes within the city. The nature of anywheels operation sits in the middle of China's free parking scheme and New York’s designated docs. Bikes in Singapore can be parked at designated zones demarcated by QR codes. This method of operation is able to optimize efficiency and convenience whilst still keeping the city clean. It’s important to note that bikeshare businesses have tried in the past to enter Singapore’s market however have failed due to not being able to align with the LTA’s standards. In an transcribed article from a podcast featuring the founder of Anywheel, Htay Aung, Aung explains the process of acquiring bicycles which have integrated SIM cards and GPS-enabled locks as supposed to bluetooth ones (Htay) so that the bikes are able to report accurate live location to meet the LTA guidelines. The success of Anywheel derives from the close collaboration between Anywheel and the Singapore government as well as its extensive bike infrastructure consisting of over 600 km of bike paths (LTA). Whilst LTA doesn’t provide anywheel with any monterey funds, the shared equal responsibility towards the bikeshare system results in a polished integration of the bike share system within the nation.

            The main bikeshare provider across the whole of France is a business called Velib. Compared to all the other bike share companies that have been looked at, Velib is far the oldest. Velib was started in 2007 and continues to flourish in the current market. Similar to the other cities we looked at, there is extensive bike infrastructure (1000 km worth of bike paths (González)) in Paris. Whilst it is true Paris does have one of the oldest biking cultures amongst these major cities, it is not purely the biking culture which has allowed for Velib to continuously grow to the state it is today. What is truly surprising is the fact that the trips made within Paris by bikes greatly surpasses that of cars (11.2% to 4.3% respectively(González)). If it isn’t obvious already, what allows Velib to flourish and continuously grow is monterey support from officials and the city mayor, Hidalgo. The city has plans to be completely suitable for two wheeled transports by 2026 (González)), 250 million has been set aside, 100 million more than the amount set in Hidalgo’s first time to accelerate the development and integration of bikes. The sophisticated bike network especially shines during rush hour with 18.9% of trips are made by bikes and only 6.6% by cars (González). However one issue which arises is that with a growing audience for bikes, the bike traffic becomes more dense and there is a need for more infrastructure to accommodate for the flow of these cyclists.         </div>

    As seen from the research, all three of the cities above have taken very different approaches to bikeshare to reach success, whether through a competitive market leading to high saturation and accessibility, strong partnership between bike providers and the government, both monetary and non-monetary or sophisticated bike infrastructure to incentivize the use of bikes. Whilst project violet wheels aims to increase bike usage within the NYU community, the bigger goal is to influence New York City on a city wide scale, hence it is important to understand how our proposed solution within NYC can fit into the bigger picture of things and create lasting impact on NYC as a whole. New York City has already made drastic changes to its infrastructure, adding hundreds of lane miles over the last decade; however what it lacks is the partnership between its bike provider and the government authorities. Citibike till today is still a privately owned business which does not receive any funding from the mayor, now the question is what can we do within NYU to bridge that gap.

        With a better understanding of what NYC needs to improve its bike share system. This section will zoom in even closer, looking at existing bike programs in other colleges and take inspiration to form New York University’s very own bikeshare program/scheme on campus with the goal of creating a lasting impact on NYC’s bike scene. The colleges which will be researched are as follows: Yale University, Stony Brook University and Binghamton University    </div>

                Yale has a fully student run bikeshare program within their campus which is free of charge. Students can rent out the bikes for 11 hour time frames, on the premises that the students attend the bikes in a proper manner within that period of time. Yale’s bike share scheme is different from conventional standard bike schemes in the sense that you are able to choose and borrow out different style bikes previously donated by the students. What is fascinating about the project is that the bikeshare program is run independently from Yale University, it is a completely student led program without any monetary endorsement. Recognizing the capital-intensive and financial barrier of running a large scale bikeshare program, the Yale Student Bikeshare seeks to redefine what it means to have a "bikeshare" on Yale's campus (Yale Student Bikeshare).            </div>

                Stony Brook University offers a comprehensive school bike share program. Students have to watch a safety waiver video and wear the proper protective equipment to use the bicycles around campus. The mandated safety training ensures a heightened awareness of safety and more responsible biking practices (Stonybrook). Whilst Stony Brook’s campus is unlike NYU’s city campus, the emphasis on safety can be implemented regardless of the setting. In terms of the bikeshare rental itself. Students at Stony Brook can unlock a bike using their SBU ID card at solar-powered kiosks, with the first 60 minutes of each ride free. The initiative both aims to promote a positive environmental impact as well as promote physical and social health amongst students around campus (Stonybrook).

                Binghamton university situated north of New York has it’s own bike scheme that allows students to rent out bikes for free (2 hours free and then charged afterwards). Whilst not extremely large in operating scale (with 30 bikes scattered across 4 stations around campus), Binghamton is one of the few universities which have launched its own standardized branded bikes, mimicking that of larger bikeshare firms like Citibik (Binghamton University).

                    In March 2025, our team gathered nearly 70 survey responses from members of the NYU community on the New York City campus. Approximately 90% of respondents were students, both commuters and those living in on-campus housing, while the remaining 10% were staff and administrators. When asked about their current transportation habits, 83% reported relying primarily on walking or the subway to get around the city. Despite this, 84% of respondents said they never use CitiBikes. However, interest in biking is clearly present: 87% indicated they would be more likely to use CitiBikes if key improvements were made, such as reduced costs or subsidized memberships, more stations near NYU buildings, safer bike lanes and traffic regulations, and greater education around bike safety and city laws. Support for making biking more accessible was also strong: 64% of respondents believe Citi Bike should be free for all NYU students, and 55% said they would bike more often if such a program were implemented. <br><br>
                    These findings suggest that NYU has a significant opportunity to shift transportation habits and foster a culture of sustainable mobility. By addressing financial and safety barriers, the university could empower more students to adopt biking as a regular part of their routines - reducing emissions, easing congestion, and promoting a healthier campus and city environment.

            <div class="paragraph3" style="text-align: left">
                To increase biking among NYU students and promote sustainable transportation, we propose two complementary initiatives: Violet Wheels, NYU’s own campus-based bike rental program, and a Citi Bike subsidized membership partnership. Together, these initiatives address different transportation needs across the NYU community, offering scalable ways to reduce emissions, improve accessibility, and strengthen biking culture on campus and beyond.
                Violet Wheels would function as a pilot program tailored to the NYU campus environment. Similar to Yale’s student-run bike share, this program would allow NYU students, faculty, and staff to borrow bikes from designated hubs using their university ID. Bikes would include locks and optional helmets to prioritize safety and convenience, drawing inspiration from safety-focused models like Stony Brook University’s program. By launching with a limited pool of participants through an application process, Violet Wheels can test demand, receive feedback, and iterate before expanding. It promotes community building and cultural change within NYU by normalizing biking for short, intra-campus travel, a model proven to succeed in university environments.
                The Citi Bike subsidized membership serves as a complementary strategy that broadens NYU’s reach beyond its own infrastructure. As seen in other cities and schools, subsidizing memberships through a partnership with an existing bike-share network provides greater mobility across longer distances while avoiding the operational demands of managing a large-scale program. This initiative aligns with NYU’s urban identity and mission to treat the city as an extension of its campus. Furthermore, it positions NYU as a leader among urban institutions in advancing climate-friendly commuting practices, a strategy that echoes global trends in university-city collaboration, as observed in case studies like Binghamton University’s branded bike system modeled after Citi Bike.
                Case studies from Yale, Stony Brook, and Binghamton highlight distinct takeaways that directly shaped this dual-proposal strategy. Yale demonstrates the potential of grassroots, student-led programs to foster ownership and participation, while Stony Brook's emphasis on safety protocols underscores the importance of education in sustainable transport adoption. Binghamton's decision to create a university-branded bike system offers a model for how NYU might expand Violet Wheels into a recognizable, scalable campus fixture. These examples collectively show that successful bike share programs prioritize user safety, accessibility, and identity, lessons we have adapted into both our proposals.
                By beginning with a localized system like Violet Wheels and extending access through a Citi Bike partnership, NYU can build a phased and adaptive approach to sustainable transportation. This strategy allows NYU to pilot, evaluate, and grow its programs in alignment with both student needs and city infrastructure. Over time, NYU could not only establish itself as a biking-forward campus but also serve as a model for other urban universities looking to invest in greener, more inclusive transit solutions.

    <div class="paragraph"><p>
        Though our long term solution might take up to a year to implement, there are steps that NYU students can take right now to help. First, students can sign our petition that advocates for NYU collaborating with CitiBike. This will hopefully bring attention to our solution and start to get NYU administrators on board. Students can also start biking on their own! We think everyone should take one bike ride and reconsider our proposal. Hopefully students see that it is not as hard as it looks! Whether students buy a bike or use bike share programs around campus, biking to and from class can help the climate and start to make a NYU biking program more necessary. Lastly, they can advocate for NYU biking on their own. We hope to create clubs, such as the tranquil biking club, that can be joined. By joining a club, or advocating on their own, students can bring more attention to this issue and make the solution more feasible. As the months warm up, we hope to see more NYU students biking with us on the streets of New York.
